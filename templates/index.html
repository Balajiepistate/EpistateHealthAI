            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visual Detection:</strong> Identifies potential anomalies such as cavities, bone density loss, impacted teeth, periapical radiolucency, and restoration issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Structural Description:</strong> Analyzes and labels dental anatomy: molars, incisors, crowns, implants, fillings, bridges, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Preliminary Treatment Suggestions:</strong> Offers suggestions such as scaling, restoration, root canal therapy, extraction, or periodontal follow-up — based on the visual evidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparative Review:</strong> Assists in comparing before-and-after images to assess treatment effectiveness over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Communication Support:</strong> Generates clear, layperson-friendly summaries and visual references to help dentists educate patients.</li>
                <li><strong>Workflow Support:</strong> Accelerates case discussions, treatment planning, and second-opinion generation — especially in high-volume practices.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Note to Users</h3>
            <p>
                EpistateHealth AI is designed as a clinical support tool to enhance dental professionals' workflows.  
                It performs best with high-quality, well-lit oral images or clear panoramic/periapical X-rays.  
                Interpretations and treatment suggestions are probabilistic in nature, based on general datasets.  
                Clinical decisions must always incorporate clinical judgment, patient history, and in-person examination.  
                The tool is best used for preliminary assessment, educational explanation, and treatment planning discussions.
